                Signs of Overwatering Your Plants?

            </p2>





            <p3 class="text-1xl font-semibold leading-normal m-4 p-8">

                How do I know if I am overwatering my houseplants?
Overwatering is a relatively easy mistake to diagnose, and many symptoms of overwatering are unique to it. When diagnosing a sad plant sign, it is important to look at the plant as a whole, and not just the plant part that's negatively affected. Although we think of overwatering as just adding too much water to a plant's potting mix — what is really going on is that the surrounding soil is not drying out fast enough. It may very well be from too much water (and most commonly is), but it may also be from not enough natural sunlight. If you water a plant with the appropriate amount of water, but it does not get enough sunlight, then the potting mix will stay moist, and the plant will be effectively overwatered. A good strategy for combating that is watering in the morning hours. And, if your home needs a boost of natural sunlight, consider adding a grow light.

The first thing you should do, when diagnosing an overwatered plant, is to feel the plant's potting mix! Feel the mix a few inches deep. If it feels moist or wet, it is most likely overwatered. Another sign of overwatering can be fungus gnats. Fungus gnats feed on the fungi that show up in moist environments. They proliferate when the soil stays too wet for too long. But do not fret — you can get rid of them. 

In addition to signs like wet potting mix and fungus gnats, the lower leaves of your overwatered plant will start to turn yellow, and then you may even see blackening at the base of said plant. If you see base mushiness or rot, it may be game over for your plant depending on the variety, so try to catch it early.

The best way to keep a plant from being overwatered is to give the plant water only when the potting mix is dry — and to give it enough light and warmth to help dry out efficiently. It is definitely easier to overwater a plant in a non-draining container, so consider repotting to a planter with drainage holes (or add a layer of lava rocks to the bottom of a container within holes).

            Why some prefer nursery grow pots?

           </p4> 





            <p5 class="text-1xl font-semibold leading-normal m-4 p-8">
                
Some plant parents prefer to keep their plants potted in their nursery grow pots within decorative planters for months, as long as the plant still has room to grow. They do this for a variety of reasons, some of which you will find below:

Ease of watering: Grow pots have drainage holes so you do not have to be as mindful when you water
Added planter choice: Grow pots give you the ability to use decorative planters that do not have drainage holes (à la cachepot) - the decorative planter serves as a saucer, catching excess water that drains out
Easier to move: Easily move your plant from one decorative pot to another when refreshing your decor, without added weight
Time of year: If it is fall or winter, the plant is semi-dormant and growing slow, so it does not need more room or new nutrients
About that last bullet… did you know even indoor plants can be on a seasonal schedule? The best time to repot your plant, be it introducing a new planter or simply providing fresh new soil, is during the spring or summer growing season. This is when plants will have the energy—thanks to more sun and longer days—to make use of the new nutrients in fresh soil and grow into the extra space of a new planter.

When to consider fully potting
So now that you know you can keep your plant in its grow pot if you prefer, here are some reasons why you would want to eventually pot it into its planter, outside of aesthetic preferences.

It is grown up: You know your plant has outgrown the nursery grow pot if...
Roots are growing through the drainage holes at the bottom of the grow pot
Roots are pushing the plant up, out of the grow pot
It is top heavy, and falls over easily
It is growing slower than normal (outside of winter dormancy)
The size of the plant is three times or more the size of the grow pot
Dry potting mix: Your plant is potting mix dries out more quickly than usual, requiring more frequent waterings
It is the season: Your plant could use fresh potting mix and more space for the spring or summer growing season
